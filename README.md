# Python_RPG
Simple role playing team game using attack, magic and items! This is an intro to Python with classes, syntax and common structures.

Uses Python 3

Clone, CD to directory, and python3 RPG.py

Alternative open the project in VS Code (needs the python plugins and choose your environment) and run it in the IDE

A little rough, but it's working... needs some improvement.

Built with VSCode (which is awesome)

Enjoy!
