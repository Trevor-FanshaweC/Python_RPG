# Python_RPG
Simple text-based role playing team game using attack, magic and items! This is an intro to procedural Python with classes, syntax and common structures taken from the StackSkills Python course.

Uses Python 3 with minimal packages.

Clone, CD to directory; to play, open a new terminal (or stick with the original) and `python3 RPG.py`

Alternatively, open the project in VS Code (needs the MS python plugins and you'll need to choose environment) and run it in the IDE

A little rough, but it's working... needs some improvement => enemies need some logic for their magic; cash isn't really working properly and spell cost needs some tweaking. But it's getting there!

Also needs some work on the formatting... text games don't look great

Built with VSCode (which is awesome)

Dependencies:

Python 3, pylinter, VSCode MS plugins (optional) and working knowledge RE Terminal

Enjoy!
